Default theme for 2020.

== Description ==

Our default theme for 2020 is designed to take full advantage of the
flexibility of the block editor. Organizations and businesses have the
ability to create dynamic landing pages with endless layouts using the
group and column blocks. The centered content column and fine-tuned
typography also makes it perfect for traditional blogs. Complete editor
styles give you a good idea of what your content will look like, even
before you publish. You can give your site a personal touch by changing
the background colors and the accent color in the Customizer. The colors of
all elements on your site are automatically calculated based on the colors
you pick, ensuring a high, accessible color contrast for your visitors.
