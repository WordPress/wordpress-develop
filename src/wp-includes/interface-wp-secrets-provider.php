/**
 * Interface for a secrets provider.
 *
 * A provider is responsible for a secret: storing it, protecting it, and returning
 * it to a caller. It is the outermost extension point in the Secrets API, and the
 * one a hosting platform implements.
 *
 * WordPress ships WP_Secrets_Libsodium_Provider, which encrypts with libsodium and
 * stores ciphertext in the options tables. That provider is the default rather than
 * a privileged case: a platform that protects credentials in a key management
 * service, a hardware security module, or its own control panel implements this
 * same interface.
 *
 * A provider must be stronger than the default, never weaker. Storing a plaintext
 * where the default would have stored ciphertext is what this interface exists to
 * prevent. Receiving a value over an authenticated channel and holding it in a
 * hardware security module satisfies that requirement.
 *
 * WordPress cannot verify any of this. A provider is loaded from a drop-in, which is
 * fully trusted code: it runs before plugins, and could already read every secret by
 * implementing the keyring. get_protection_boundary() and is_writable() are
 * declarations rather than enforcement. They exist so that a developer reviewing a
 * drop-in can see what it claims, Site Health can report where credentials are
 * protected, and a settings screen can determine that a write will be refused before
 * an operator enters a credential. They are not a security boundary.
 *
 * Every implementation shares these contracts:
 *
 * - Three states, never collapsed. get() returns a WP_Secret, null when the secret
 *   does not exist, or WP_Error when it exists but cannot be produced. Reporting an
 *   unreachable backend as absent turns an outage into an apparently deleted
 *   credential.
 * - Fail closed. A provider that cannot answer returns WP_Error. It never
 *   substitutes a weaker source, and never returns a partial or placeholder value.
 * - No filter on the retrieval path. A provider replaces a component; it is not a
 *   hook. Nothing is given the opportunity to observe or alter a value in transit.
 * - Never persist a value more weakly than the provider protects it. A provider that
 *   fetches over the network must not write the plaintext into the persistent object
 *   cache. WP_Secret cannot round-trip a plaintext through wp_cache_set(), and
 *   caching the raw value alongside it would undo that. Memoize within the request
 *   only.
